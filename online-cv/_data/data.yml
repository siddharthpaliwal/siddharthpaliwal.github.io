    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am a PhD student in the Soft Condensed Matter Group in the Utrecht University currently in my 4th year. My research 
        is based on the computational study of Self-propelled nanoparticles to assist theoretical understanding of Active systems.
        My project is a part of the Shell-NWO/FOM Computational Sciences for Energy Research program. I'm interested in solving physics 
        and engineering problems through numerical modelling and simulations.
